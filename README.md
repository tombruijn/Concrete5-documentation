Concrete5 manuals
---

This is documentation I wrote during my Internship at Ingram Micro Netherlands. I wrote this in May 2009 and have then shared it with the community at [concrete5.org](http://concrete5.org) under the Creative Commons license [here](http://www.concrete5.org/community/forums/documentation_efforts/user_documentation_-_done/#12966).

I'm only putting this in a repository now, because I recently came across it again and realized I didn't put it in a repo then since I was unaware of any SCM at that time.

It's pretty much here for me not to lose it again.
